# Mario Sokoban
Mario Sokoban is a program (in french) written in C and inspired by the classical japanese video game of Sokoban.

Your goal is to help Mario to move the boxes in the right places.

I've created 200 different levels!!!

The idea of this program come from the wonderfull website "Openclassrooms" which is made for beginners to learn programing langages. I've learned C from there : https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-programmer-en-c

Don't hesitate to sent me coments or to improve this code by sending me some PR.

Now you can also download the setup executable file for Windows OS in : https://sourceforge.net/projects/mario-sokoban/

Enjoy :)
